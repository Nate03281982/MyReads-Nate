#MyReads Project Overview:

MyReads is a project that has two parts.  The first part is a page that lets you categorize books in three different ways.  The first way is currently reading.  The second way is want to read. The last way is read.  I used react code to allow the books to be categorized.  The second part of the MyReads project is a search page.  I used react code to allow a search of books and a way to categorize them.
